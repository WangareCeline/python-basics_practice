# Python Fundamentals Practice Notebook - Summary

## 📋 Overview
This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates fundamental Python programming concepts through practical examples and exercises. It covers essential programming building blocks for beginners as part of a larger data analysis learning path.

## 🎯 Core Concepts Covered

### 1. **Variables & Data Types**
- **String variables**: `name = "Celine"` with printing
- **Numeric types**: Integer (`a = 10`) and Float (`b = 3.14`) with type checking
- **Boolean logic**: `is_student = True` with conditional printing
- **None type**: Demonstrating `x = None` and its type
- **Variable swapping**: `m, n = n, m` technique without temporary variable

### 2. **Conditional Statements (if/elif/else)**
- **Password verification**: User input validation with `input()`
- **Number classification**: Positive/Negative checker
- **Even/Odd determination**: Using modulus operator `%`
- **Age verification**: Adult/Minor classification
- **Maximum value finder**: Using `max()` function
- **Temperature categorization**: Hot (>30), Warm (15-30), Cold (<15)

### 3. **Lists Operations**
- **List creation & access**: `fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]` with first/last element access
- **List modification**: Adding with `append()`, removing with `remove()`
- **List calculations**: Sum of numbers with `sum()`
- **String manipulation**: Joining list elements into single string
- **List reversal**: Basic list manipulation techniques

## 💡 Key Programming Skills Demonstrated

### Input/Output Operations
- User interaction via `input()` function
- Formatted output with `print()` 
- Type checking with `type()` function

### Control Flow
- Basic `if/else` decision making
- Multiple conditions with `elif`
- Logical comparisons and evaluations

### Data Structures
- List creation and indexing (positive and negative)
- List modification methods
- Basic list operations and calculations

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Code Structure
- Sequential execution of independent code cells
- Clear variable naming and comments
- Practical, real-world examples
- Error handling through conditional checks

### Execution Pattern
Each exercise follows this pattern:
1. Problem statement (implied)
2. Code implementation
3. Output demonstration
4. Progressive complexity increase

## 📈 Learning Progression
